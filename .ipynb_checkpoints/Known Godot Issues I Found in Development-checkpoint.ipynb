    "## Updating a `Path2D` Will Not Update Its Children `PathFollow2D`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference:** [Changing the position of a Path2D does not properly update the position of PathFollow2D nodes](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/20386), [Path2D does not allow for variation in offset of code-instantiated PathFollow2D instance](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/35213)\n",
    "\n",
    "After transforming a `Path2D`, what's expected to happen is that its children `PathFollow2D` nodes are transformed with it and may move along the transformed curve immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this will not happen since, for some reason, `PathFollow2D` still uses the pre-transformation path for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a [recent project](https://github.com/Cynthia7979/godot-projects/commit/88804a3604e5e333844c129a743a8856ddb3278e) I have tried several workarounds:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Manually calling `force_update_transformation()` on both `Path2D` and `PathFollow2D`\n",
    "* Duplicating a node from `PathFollow2D`, assign it as a child of `Path2D`, and then change its offset to the desired value\n",
    "* Creating both `Path2D` and `PathFollow2D` nodes anew, with the `Curve2D` already transformed to the desired state\n",
    "\n",
    "However, none of them worked. Fortunately the curve I was using for the path was very simple and I was able to re-implement it in my own code. It's noteworthy that [one of the issues](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/20386) referred to an open [pull request](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/43399) waiting for conflict solution. It seems to have solved the bug, but haven't been updated for a long time (since 2021)."
